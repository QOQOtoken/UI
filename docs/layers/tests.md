# Tests

This layer is responsible to test each layer of application. Each test file name follow `[file-name].test.jsx` pattern for naming. We use [expect](https://github.com/mjackson/expect) to write assertion for each test case. We use [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) to run our tests. We use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) which tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.
