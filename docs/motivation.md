# Motivation

In this project we follow [loosely coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) system principle with the idea each part of this project be independent from others. For example if you want to use [frontend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends) you are not depend on [backend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends) as you can use Firbase so easy which we have provided in this project. You also can use any kind of backend such as php, python, javascript and etc, completely independent of frontend or you can use [ASP.NET Core 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/) backend that we provided in this project.
As my target in this project, I've intended to build a social network with features of new and powerful web technologies such as [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) as a front-end tool in [React Social Network](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network) project and build a powerful backend by [ASP.NET Core 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/)  with its cool new features in [ASP.NET Core Social Network](https://github.com/Qolzam/aspnet-core-social-network). I also use [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) to build a powerful mobile social app in [React Mobile Social](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-mobile-social). All cool new features are providing as an open source project under MIT LICENSE and it's so great ;).
